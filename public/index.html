        <p class="info-text">
          Hello! I'm an aspiring web developer currently living in Spokane, Washington. I've been
          interested in tech for a while now, but ended up studying classical guitar in college. As
          I've gone deeper into the world of software and coding, the more I've realized the
          similarities between the two. To put it as suffinctly as possible, I love using creative
          problem solving skills to produce elegant and beautiful solutions, whether it's a web app
          or a difficult piece of music.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text">
          The core of my interests lie at the integration of Art and Science, the Classical and
          Romantic way of thinking. Earlier in life, it was the desire for creative outlet that led
          me to music. However, I quickly found out that I'm equally drawn to the study of
          technique, theory, and form in not only music, but all disciplines. In contrast, it wasn't
          the creative aspect that intially drew me to coding, but the logic and form of it all.
          However, as I've gone deeper down the rabbit hole, it's the realization of beautiful
          solutions that will keep me interested for the long run.
